<p>MineralID moved to <a href="https://www.malachi.nl">malachi.nl</a> because DigitalOcean won't two accounts network to the same domain and one of my accounts is suspended because I didn't want to pay the bills on that one so now I have to use a different domain until that account is fully terminated</p>
